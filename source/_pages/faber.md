    <p class="three-fourth">This International Women's Day, we are lifting up the achievements of 35 phenomenal UC Santa Cruz women. From astronomers and astronauts to activists, journalists, judges, and so much more, these women are trailblazers, and many have been "firsts" in their fields. For us, these women exemplify the words immortalized by the poet Maya Angelou: "I’m a woman / Phenomenally. / Phenomenal woman, / That’s me."</p>
