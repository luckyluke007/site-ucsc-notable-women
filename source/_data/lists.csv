yes,Sandra ,Faber,"Professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics
National Medal of Science recipient; Gruber Prize winner",Professor emerita,"UC Santa Cruz professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics Sandra Faber has helped transform the way we look at galaxies. In 1985, Faber, along with with Joel Primack and George Blumenthal, both from UC Santa Cruz, and Britain’s Astronomer Royal Martin Reese, produced a comprehensive theory of how cold dark matter was part of galaxy formation and evolution, a theory that still underpins today’s models of galaxy creation. Among her many discoveries, Faber also uncovered a relation between the brightness of galaxies and the speed of the stars within them, and found that a supermassive black hole resides at the center of every large galaxy. She aided in construction of the 10-meter Keck Telescope in Hawaii, helped engineers diagnose and fix what was causing focusing problems on the already orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, and later led an extensive Hubble Space Telescope survey of galaxies from the universe’s infancy. She has won the National Medal of Science and the Gruber Prize, among other awards.","National Medal of Science (2012), Gruber Prize, and many other distinctions",,,https://www.ucsc.edu/images/notable-women/sandrafaber.jpg,
